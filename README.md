### 1. Introduction

Kakuma Refugee Camp, one of the largest refugee settlements in East Africa, hosts diverse populations displaced by conflict, famine, and instability. While humanitarian agencies provide essential healthcare services, persistent challenges remain in healthcare utilization and medicine availability. This project uses data analytics to analyze health service usage, medicine stock levels, and system gaps, providing actionable insights for improved decision-making.

### 2. Problem Statement

**2.1 Key Problems**

* Overcrowded health facilities and long waiting times
* Frequent stockouts of essential medicines
* Delayed and inconsistent manual reporting
* Poor supply chain visibility
* Limited use of data for planning and decision-making

### 3. Project Objectives

* Assess healthcare utilization across facilities
* Analyze medicine stock levels and stockout trends
* Build predictive models for future medicine needs
* Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard
* Provide data-driven recommendations for health partners

### 4. Background and Rationale

Refugee settings depend heavily on data to plan interventions, yet Kakuma still faces data fragmentation, manual reporting errors, and limited analytical capacity. A well-structured data analytics system can provide accurate, timely insights to improve health outcomes.

### 5. Data Sources and Dataset Origins

This project uses authentic, publicly available, or partner-shared datasets commonly used in refugee health analytics. These datasets were obtained from trusted humanitarian and open-data platforms.

**5.1 UNHCR Health Information System (HIS) Reports**

* Monthly health utilization statistics
* Disease surveillance reports
* Health facility workload summaries
  *Source:* UNHCR Kenya Operational Data Portal (ODP)

**5.2 UNHCR Supply Chain and Pharmaceuticals Data**

* Essential medicine lists
* Facility stock levels
* Stockout and consumption trends
  *Source:* UNHCR Logistics and Supply Chain Units

**5.3 NGO and Partner Facility Data (Where Allowed)**

* Organizations: IRC, Kenya Red Cross Society, AIC Health Ministries
* Open-access annual health reports and performance reviews

**5.4 Open-Source Datasets for Modeling and Simulation**

* Kaggle Healthcare Utilization Datasets

### 6. Methodology

**6.1 Data Collection**

* Datasets imported from Excel, CSV, DHIS2 exports
* PDF reports converted to structured tables
* Partner health facility logs

**6.2 Data Cleaning**

* Handling missing values
* Normalizing medicine categories
* Standardizing dates
* Removing duplicates

**6.3 Data Analysis Techniques**

* Descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
* Trend analysis
* Medicine stock forecasting
* Patient load analysis

**6.4 Tools Used**

* Power BI, Excel, Python (Pandas), SQL, Power Query

### 7. Expected Outcomes

* Improved visibility into facility workload
* Better forecasting of medicine needs
* Reduced stockout frequency
* Real-time dashboard monitoring
* Enhanced decision-making for humanitarian agencies

### 8. Risk Management

* Data validation processes
* Staff training on analytics
* Stakeholder engagement
* Strong data security practices

### 9. Recommendations

* Digitize HMIS reporting
* Introduce automated stock tracking
* Train staff in data analytics
* Integrate partners into a unified data system
* Adopt predictive analytics for supply planning

### 10. Conclusion

This project introduces a powerful, data-driven approach for addressing healthcare utilization and medicine availability challenges in Kakuma Refugee Camp. Through comprehensive analytics, forecasting models, and a Power BI dashboard, the project enhances capacity for evidence-based planning—improving the health and well-being of refugee populations.
